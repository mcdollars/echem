This program analyses the electrochemical chronoamperometry mesurements taken by Gamry potentiostat (J. Phys. Chem. C 2017, 121, 8, 4760–4764).

The differential capacitance can be derived from the data as a function of applied bias voltage.

The obtained differential capacitance can be used to understand the changes in Electrical Double Layer at electrode-electrolyte interfaces.
